Due to an unfortunate bug in URP batching, and some associated shadergraph limitations preventing a better fix, 
modifying this shader is more complicated.

Steps:
- Modify the shadergraph and/or associated CustomLighting.hlsl custom node.
- Save
- Select the "PixelLight ShaderGraph.shadergraph" asset.
- In the inspector, click on "View Generated Shader"
- Once opened, find the "Tags" keyword. There will already be a few tags defined under it ( ex. "RenderPipeline" = "UniversalPipeline" )
- Directly under the currently existing tags add this new tag ( make sure you are still inside of the curly brackets of the Tags keyword ): 
    "DisableBatching" = "True"
- Hit ctrl+A to select the entire shader, and the click ctrl+C to copy its contents.
- Open the "PixelLight_URP.shader"
- Hit ctrl+A to select the entire shader contents, and ctrl+V to paste our updated shader into it.
- Hit ctrl+S to save.


Unfortunately, there's no better workaround as of the current Unity versions. Without this workaround, lighting would be broken whenever 2 or more sprites
share the same pixelLight material in a scene. 
Hopefully future Unity versions will come with support for adding tags in shadergraphs directly, or a fix to the batching bug.
