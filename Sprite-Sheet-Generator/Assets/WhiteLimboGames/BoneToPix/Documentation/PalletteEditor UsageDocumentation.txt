PALLETTE_EDITOR USAGE:
	
	1) By default, is autolaunched to allow editing of your albedo spritesheet at the end of every boneToPixConversion. Can also be launched on its own from the top bar: Window > WhiteLimboGames > PalletteEditor
	2) Will by default animate through frames. Framerate can be manually set. Animation can be turned off, and frames can be flipped through manually. 
	3) The left column contains a list of colors. Clicking on one of the colors allows it to be changed. The changes will be immediately reflected in the sprite on the right, even when animating.
	4) Colors can be removed from the pallette by clicking the remove button to their right.
	5) New colors can be added to the pallette by scroling to the bottom of the color column and click the "Add Color" button
	6) When satisfied, the result can be saved over the original texture with the "Save and overwrite" button. THIS OVERWRITES THE OLD FILE 
	7) The "Save Changes to new texture" saves to a separate texture, WITHOUT overwriting.
